# Blindsides Weapon Pack [Loner] v2

A weapon pack developed by Blindxside, updated and corrected in the [LONER] version. Originally announced years ago by Blindxside, this pack was later updated to the [MILITARY] version. This release restores the [LONER] base while adapting and enhancing it to support several addons.

## What's New in This Version?

The first version of this pack was reuploaded by me ([JonRads]) after the [LONER] version was updated to [MILITARY]. The primary motivation was the mandatory dependency on the JSRS addon by Solarint, which many players disliked.  
**With Blindxside's permission**, I updated the [LONER] pack and introduced several improvements.  

### New Features:  

- Updated files;  
- Revised addon description;
